Self-portrait as the Apostle Paul,oil on canvas,1661,"Rembrandt is 55 years old in this self-portrait, and he still looks at himself candidly. Here he assumes the guise of a personage from the Bible, the Apostle Paul. The sword protruding from his cloak and the manuscript in his hands are the apostle’s customary attributes. By using his own face, Rembrandt encouraged the viewer to engage personally with the saint.",https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/headless/assets/07f4d465-f831-4ca0-9797-2644f037ef07?w=1024&h=1080&useFocusPointForResize=true&format=webp
Self-portrait,oil on cardboard,1887,"Vincent moved to Paris in 1886, after hearing from his brother Theo about the new, colourful style of French painting. Wasting no time, he tried it out in several self-portraits. He did this mostly to avoid having to pay for a model. Using rhythmic brushstrokes in striking colours, he portrayed himself here as a fashionably dressed Parisian.",https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/headless/assets/07f4d465-f831-4ca0-9797-2644f037ef07?w=1024&h=1080&useFocusPointForResize=true&format=webp
Portrait of Marie Jeanette de Lange,oil on canvas,1900,"Marie Jeanette de Lange chaired the Vereeniging voor Verbetering van Vrouwenkleding (Association for the Improvement of Women’s Clothing), which championed hygienic, loose-fitting, natural clothing that allowed women greater freedom of movement. In February 1900 she posed at home, dressed comfortably, for Jan Toorop.

Isabella,oil on canvas,c. 1906,"In creating this portrait, Maris first took photographs of the young girl as reference material. Thanks to those pictures and other documents in Maris’ archive, we know the girl was about twelve years old when she posed for him. Maris made several portraits of her, some bearing the title Isabella, including this painting. This was possibly not her real name, as models commonly used aliases.",https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/api/headless/assets/07f4d465-f831-4ca0-9797-2644f037ef07?w=1024&h=1080&useFocusPointForResize=true&format=webp
